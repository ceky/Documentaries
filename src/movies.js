    "description": "The movie make the portait of this excentric singer that wrote her songs based on personal experinces. Such a brilliant voice and it sounds so refreshing. Loved how she followed her own way of not singing pop shitty songs even even if she knew will never sell so good as the pop singers. The movie presents different sides of her life letting the viewer to know more about her personality. Music lovers will definitely enjoy this one."
