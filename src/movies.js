      "The movie make the portait of this excentric singer that wrote her songs based on personal experinces. Such a brilliant voice and it sounds so refreshing.

The movie presents different sides of her life letting the viewer to know more about her personality. Music lovers will definitely enjoy this one."

    description:
      "A portrait of the homeless population who live permanently in the underground tunnels of New York City. Most of the people in this film certainly didn't make the right decisions in life, some were openly smoking crack on camera, but none of them tried to make any excuses for things they've done in the past to get them where they were. And that is what I think ultimately made me feel sympathetic to them."

    description:
      "Another perspective on the global warming and the melting of the glaciers in the Arctic told by a National Geographic photographer that captures the process using time-lapse cameras. The images are both stunning and sad showing the gravity of the situation. The way we're living and consuming nowadays is only accelerating the melting process and so the planet is changing faster than ever before. If you're looking for an evidence of the dramatic degradation of the planet's glaciers then don't miss this spectacular documentary."
